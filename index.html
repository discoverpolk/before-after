Please join us for a fun evening as we celebrate all things creative in our community. This event is aimed to casually connect people in a relaxed 
and inspired setting, and celebrate the launch of our important community resource: the Creative Assets Inventory. Come together, be inspired by 
ArtYard's amazing Kahn & Selesnick Exhibition, and enjoy wine and light refreshments. There will be a short presentation in ArtYard's Theatre at 5:30.

<h1>About this Project</h1>
Sustainable Frenchtown and the Hunterdon County Creative Team are conducting an inventory of all things creative in and around the Frenchtown area. Knowing what we have, who we are, and where we work and play is the first step in building a creative network. 
<br><br>
The success of this project depends on <b>YOU!</b> A <a href="directory.html">comprehensive inventory</a> and <a href="map.html">map</a> of our assets is the first step to advancing and developing the arts in our area. <a href="survey.html">Add your assets</a>, spread the word, and get involved! Contact us at <a href="mailto:creativeteam.assets@gmail.com">creativeteam.assets@gmail.com</a>.
